    <supplementalInfo>Port of Call: Newport, RI
Experiment Type: Research Cruise
Cruise Info: AOML_SOOP_OA
The analytical system operated fine during this cruise. 
  The SBE38 SST sensor was replaced at the start of this field season, and for an undetermined reason, the measured SST values were not reliable. 
  The data from one of the ship's through hull sensors (MidSea at 3 meters) was used for SST values.  A bracketing 1-minute average of this sensor showed smooth, reliable behavior and was used for processing. 
  For 70 minutes starting at 13:40 on 11 March, the through-hull SST sensors were not recorded.  For this interval, SST was estimated from the equilibrator temperature.  
  Original Data Location:  http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/ocd/ocdweb/bigelow/bigelow_introduction.html . 
  Full unprocessed data files from analytical instrument including flow information plus meteorological and TSG data at time of sampling can be obtained upon request.</supplementalInfo>

            <analyzingInstrument>CO2 Sensor: Manufacturer: LI-COR; Model: 6262; Calibration: The analyzer is calibrated every 3.5 hours with field standards that in turn were calibrated with primary standards that are directly traceable to the WMO X2019 scale. The zero gas is ultra-high purity air.; Number of non-zero gases: 4; Measured CO2 Parameters: xco2(dry); Instrument is located in an air-conditioned laboratory.  Ultra-High Purity air (0.0 ppm CO2) and the high standard gas are used to zero and span the LI-COR analyzer.</analyzingInstrument>
