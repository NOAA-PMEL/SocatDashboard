  <suppleInfo>Port of Call: Lonyearbyen, Norway
Experiment Type: SOOP_Line
Cruise Info: AOML_SOOP_CO2
The analytical system operated well during this cruise.  The seawater pump was not run while the ship was among ice.
The LICOR pressure sensor showed a drift from normal operation.  The LICOR pressure was estimated by subtracting 1.6 mbar from the sea surface atmospheric pressure.  The offset between the LICOR and atmospheric pressures was measured during the first cruise, WFCH20220424.
The XCO2 output of the LI-6262 was recalculated with the updated pressures before processing the pCO2 raw data.
